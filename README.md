# Overview

> "In the similar spirit of _reducing the barriers_ that we did with SR Linux, we distribute the free EDA version by publishing EDA components in the public container registry. Leaving you no excuses not to try it :brain:" - Roman Dodin

The workshop will primarily focus on getting familiar with the key concepts in EDA. As such, we are not going to spend a lot of time diving deep into the inner workings of EDA. We hope that participating in this workshop will whet your appetite. Since EDA is free (as in :beer:) to try, you can easily spin up your own installation and get as wild as you want!
